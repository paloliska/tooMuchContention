test tooMuchContentionException thrown by Debry

This code is trying to make derby throw tooMuchContentionException during generating new id for inserting row.
There is one test class with 3 tests. 
All test *could* fail, but depends on hardware and setup.
 Setup: 
    TEST_TIMEOUT = how long will test run
    nThreads = number of threads
